Code that the team wrote that is run on the CyMote is included in 
the atmel directory.  Code that the team wrote that is run on the PC 
side is included in the pcwrapper directory.  The code cannot be compiled 
with just these files, you need the atmel studio project files, visual 
studio project files, and various other dependencies, but for readability 
and ease of exploration of the work we have done, we have organized it this 
way.

Link to our development repo that has the all project files:

The runnable version of our CyMote program is in Cymote/Cymote2.  The 
runnable version of our PC Wrapper is in PC_Wrapper/ConsoleApplication2.
