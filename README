Code that the team wrote that is run on the CyMote is included in 
the atmel directory.  The code cannot be compiled with just this, 
you need the atmel project files, but for readability and ease of 
exploration of the work we have done, we have organized it this way.

Code that the team wrote that is run on the PC side is inclued in
the pcwrapper directory.  This code cannot be compiled with just what
is included, you need the visual studio project file, but for readability
we have organized it this way.
